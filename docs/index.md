# FPM: Funding-Productivity Model

The FPM is a model that relates funding to productivity. It is a simple model that can be used to understand the relationship between funding and company productivity. The model is based on the idea that funding is a key driver of productivity, and that the relationship between the two is not linear. Instead, the relationship is likely to be non-linear, with diminishing returns to funding. This means that as funding increases, the increase in productivity will eventually start to level off.

## Background

The FPM is a model that relates funding to productivity. It is a simple model that can be used to understand the relationship between funding and productivity. The model is based on the idea that funding is a key driver of productivity, and that the relationship between the two is not linear. Instead, the relationship is likely to be non-linear, with diminishing returns to funding. This means that as funding increases, the increase in productivity will eventually start to level off.

## Model

The FPM is built on the SEM model. The SEM model is a statistical model that is used to estimate the relationship between a set of observed variables and a set of latent variables. The model is based on the idea that the observed variables are caused by the latent variables, and that the relationship between the two can be estimated using a set of structural equations.

## Data Criteria

To make the model work and stable, we need to have a good amount of data and make sure the companies included in the data set are with transparent financials and have a good reputation in the market. Also the companies in the data set should be from the same industry segment, so they hae similar business models and are comparable.

### Business Criteria

Enterprise Software and Cloud Services

### Macro Economic Criteria

We should constraint the data set to companies that are operating in the same macro economic environment, so we can compare the productivity of the companies in the same environment.
