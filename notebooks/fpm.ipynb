    "\n",
    "1. **Productivity is proportional to funding**: The productivity of the lab is assumed to be proportional to the funding it receives. This is a simplifying assumption, but it is a common one in the literature on research funding.\n",
    "1. **Diminishing returns to funding**: The relationship between funding and productivity is assumed to be concave, meaning that the marginal productivity of funding decreases as funding increases. This is also a common assumption in the literature on research funding.\n",
    "1. **Lag between funding and productivity**: The effect of funding on productivity is assumed to be lagged, meaning that funding in one year affects productivity in the following year. This is a common assumption in the literature on research funding."
